                Once every decade, 
                <br>
                <br>
                elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing.
                <br>
                <br>
                To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon known as Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined.
