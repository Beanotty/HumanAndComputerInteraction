    <h1>What is MyTrickster?</h1>
    <br>
        <p>
            MyTrickster takes place in a shared low fantasy setting where the human species have technology, such as steam power, but continue to study the ruins of a long-past advanced civilization.
            In the the less populated regions, monsters roam the landscape and threaten small villages or research bases that have been established to study the ruins and these monsters. Take the role of a Hunter that serves 
            to help protect the villages and bases from these monsters, typically aiding in researching these.

            In the far reaches of Drakoria, an ancient heavenly event known as the The Rampage has consumed powerful monsters and transformed animals, 
            <br>
            driven by fear, these creatures threaten the peaceful coexistence of mankind and the other species that call the continent home.

         <p>
            primarily out of wood, some taken from the very ships that brought the 
            <br>
            Research Commission to the New World.
            <br><br>
            Astera is more of a base than a village, built to support the Hunters and 
            <br>
            researchers as they explore the New World and its ecology. It is built in three primary tiers. 
            <br>
            Winding stairs and a waterwheel-powered series of chain pulleys serve to move people 
            <br>
            and supplies from one tier to the other quickly.
